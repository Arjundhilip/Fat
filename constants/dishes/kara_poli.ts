Originally, Polis are sweet flatbreads stuffed with a lentil and jaggery filling, savored during festive occasions across South India. Kara Poli, however, ventures into the realm of savory, incorporating a spicy potato and pea filling, seasoned with a medley of Indian spices. This innovative variant transforms the Poli from a dessert into a versatile snack or meal, perfect for any time of the day. It's a testament to the dynamic nature of Indian cuisine, where even the most traditional recipes are open to reinterpretation and adaptation, reflecting the diversity and creativity inherent in Indian culinary practices.`,
