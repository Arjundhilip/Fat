    des: `This fish curry is a culinary staple in the coastal district of Cuddalore, where the sea's bounty meets the land's rich culinary traditions. Renowned for its aromatic blend of spices and the unique addition of 'Thalippu Vengaya Vadagam'—a sun-dried seasoning ball made of shallots and spices—this curry is a testament to the ingenuity of Tamil Nadu's coastal cuisine. The use of Pomfret, known locally as 'Vavaal Meen,' and the rich, tangy tamarind base complement each other perfectly, creating a harmonious symphony of flavors. Each household in Cuddalore may have its own version of this dish, but the essence lies in the freshly ground coconut-onion paste and the vadagam that elevates the curry to a whole new level of deliciousness.`,
