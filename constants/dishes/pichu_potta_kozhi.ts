This dish is especially popular in Tamil Nadu, where the art of cooking chicken is elevated with a blend of local spices that tease the palate and awaken the senses. Traditionally cooked in a communal setting, this dish is a celebration of both simplicity and flavor, featuring tender shredded chicken stir-fried with aromatic spices and fresh herbs. It's a perfect example of how everyday ingredients can be transformed into a delightful meal.`,
