This unique drink, made from cotton seeds and rice, is a hidden gem in the realm of traditional Indian beverages. Originating from rural Tamil Nadu, Paruthi Paal was initially consumed for its cooling properties and as a remedy for various ailments, owing to its nutritious ingredients. The combination of cotton seeds and rice, enriched with the sweetness of jaggery and the creaminess of coconut milk, creates a beverage that is not only comforting but also deeply nourishing. Enhanced with the aromatic spices of cardamom and dry ginger, Paruthi Paal offers a soothing, mildly spiced flavor profile that is as delightful as it is therapeutic.`,
