This idli variant is steeped in tradition and is much revered in South Indian cuisine for its unique flavors and the ritualistic way it's prepared, often as an offering in temples. The recipe is distinguished by its seasoning with ginger, peppercorns, cumin, and the aromatic ghee-infused tempering, which imparts a divine taste to the idlis. Wrapped and steamed in banana leaves, these idlis carry a hint of the leaf's fragrance, making them a special variant of the otherwise simple South Indian staple.`,
