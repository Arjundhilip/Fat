    des: `Kongunadu Kozhi Vellai Biriyani is a culinary gem from the Kongunadu region of Tamil Nadu, known for its aromatic and flavorful dishes. This unique biriyani stands out for its delicate use of green chillies and the rich, creamy texture imparted by coconut milk. Unlike the more common, robustly spiced biriyanis, this version celebrates the subtle yet profound flavors of ground spices and the distinctive aroma of seeraga samba rice. Traditionally cooked in a clay pot, this biriyani is a testament to the art of balancing flavors and textures, creating a dish that is both rich and subtle, spicy and soothing.`,
