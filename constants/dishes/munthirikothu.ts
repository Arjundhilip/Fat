The name 'Munthiri Kothu' literally translates to 'cluster of grapes' in Malayalam and Tamil, alluding to the appearance of these fried sweet balls when clustered together. This delicacy is often made during festivals and special occasions, symbolizing joy and togetherness. The combination of jaggery and coconut brings a natural sweetness and richness to the dish, while the green gram adds a nutty flavor and a crunchy texture. Deep-fried to golden perfection, these sweet balls are a testament to the simple yet profound flavors of South Indian cuisine.`,
