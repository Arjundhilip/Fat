        "name": 'Ingredients & Preparation:',
        "description": 'The distinguishing feature of Dindigul Chicken Biryani is the use of seeraga samba rice, a short-grain, aromatic variety native to Tamil Nadu, which differs from the longer Basmati rice. The chicken is marinated with yogurt and spices like red chili powder, coriander powder, and turmeric. The biryani base includes ginger-garlic paste, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaves, and star anise. A ground masala paste made of fennel seeds, poppy seeds, and other spices adds depth to the dish. After sautéing the spices and masala paste in ghee, the marinated chicken is added, followed by the seeraga samba rice. The entire mixture is cooked slowly, allowing the flavors to infuse fully, resulting in tender chicken and fluffy, flavorful rice.',
