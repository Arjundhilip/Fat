        "description": 'To prepare Manoharam, besan (gram flour) is made into a dough, often with a little rice flour added for extra crispness. The dough is then shaped into small coils or beads using a mold or a press. These shaped dough pieces are deep-fried until golden brown. Once fried, the crispy pieces are immediately tossed in warm, melted jaggery syrup flavored with cardamom, sometimes with a hint of dried ginger powder (chukku) for an extra layer of flavor.',
