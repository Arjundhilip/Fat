        "name": 'Ingredients & Preparation:',
        "description": 'This biryani typically uses seeraga samba rice, a short-grain, aromatic variety native to Tamil Nadu. The meat (often mutton or chicken) is marinated with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and spices like cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The cooking starts by frying whole spices like cinnamon, cloves, and star anise in ghee. Onions and tomatoes are then sautéed until golden brown. The marinated meat is added, followed by rice and freshly ground masala. The biryani is then cooked in layers, allowing the meat and rice to absorb the aromatic flavors of the spices. Unlike some other biryanis, Enangulathur Biryani is known for its emphasis on using fresh herbs like mint and coriander to balance the bold spices.',
